# Calculating Berry curvature on a quantum computer

Berry curvature is one of the central concepts in condensed matter theory. For some parameterized Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}(\alpha, \beta, \dots)$, Berry curvature of the $n$-th level can be calculated through

$$
    B^{\alpha\beta}_n = -2\text{Im}\langle\partial_\alpha\psi_n|\partial_\beta\psi_n\rangle.  
$$
