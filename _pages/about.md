I'm a PhD student in the Applied Quantum Algorithms (aQa) group at Leiden University under the supervision of Vedran Dunjko and Jordi Tura.
My research interests include the application of classical machine learning methods to improve the performance of quantum devices and quantum algorithms and the exploration of quantum machine learning algorithms.
